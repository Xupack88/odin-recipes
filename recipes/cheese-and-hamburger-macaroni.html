      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef,
        onion, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper in the hot
        skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and
        discard grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase heat to high. Add water to ground beef mixture in the skillet.
        Cover and bring to a boil. Stir macaroni into boiling water-ground beef
        mixture. Cover, lower heat to medium, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir,
        cover, and continue cooking until macaroni is tender, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir processed cheese food into ground beef-macaroni mixture until
        melted. Remove from heat; stir in sour cream.
